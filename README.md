# Foreign-Exchange-Rate-Time-series-Datascience-Project
This project will use time series analysis to forecast the exchange rate between the euro and the US dollar. The project will use a variety of statistical techniques, such as ARIMA to model the data and forecast the exchange rate.
## Problem Statement:
The euro to USD conversion rate is a volatile market, and it can be difficult to predict how the exchange rate will change over time. This can make it difficult for businesses and individuals to make informed decisions about currency exchange.
## Solution Approach:
One way to improve the predictability of the Euro to USD exchange rate is to use time series analysis. Time series analysis is a statistical technique that can be used to identify patterns in data over time. By identifying these patterns, it is possible to make more accurate predictions about the future value of the exchange rate.
## Observation:
The following observations were made during the time series analysis of the Euro to USD exchange rate:
* The exchange rate is highly volatile, with significant fluctuations over short periods of time.
* There is no seasonal patterns in the exchange rates.
* The exchange rate is also affected by a number of economic factors, such as inflation, and economic growth.
## Findings:
The following findings were made during the time series analysis of the Euro to USD Exchange Rate:
* However, the exchange rate is still a very volatile market and it is impossible perfect prediction.
* Since the data is daily data, it can be very volatile and it cannot be used to model fitting or prediction.
* The exchange rates can be affected by various reasons such as political conditions, elections and inflation.
## Insights:
The findings of this project provides insights into the factor that can influence the Euro to USD exchange rate. this information can be used by businesses and individuals to make more informed decisions about currency exchange.For example, businesses that export goods to Europe may want to hedge their currency risk by buying euros in advance. Individuals who are planning to travel to Europe may want to wait until the exchange rate is favorable before exchanging their currency. The time series analysis used in this project is a powerful tool for understanding and predicting currency exchange rates. However, it is important to note that the future is uncertain, and there is no guarantee that the exchange rate will follow the same trends in the future as it has in the past.

Overall, this project has provided valuable insights into the euro to USD exchange rate. This information can be used by businesses and individuals to make more informed decisions about currencyÂ exchange.
